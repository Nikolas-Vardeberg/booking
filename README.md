# Booking System

This is a fun project I created to build a booking system for myself. The idea is to have a place where I can easily book services, such as appointments or reservations. I used a combination of technologies including Sanity, Prisma, PlanetScale, Next.js, Shadcn UI, Kinde, and Stripe to implement this project.

## Features

- Users can book services with specified dates, durations, and times.
- Backend handles storing and retrieving booking data.
- Integration with Stripe for payment processing.

## Technologies Used

- Sanity: For content management and data modeling.
- Prisma: ORM for database management.
- PlanetScale: Scalable database solution.
- Next.js: React framework for building frontend.
- Shadcn UI: UI component library.
- Kinde: Utility library for common tasks.
- Stripe: Payment processing solution.
